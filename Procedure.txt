Procedure:
1) Setting Up Meta data, like: 
2) Csv to Data
3) Create the conditions to check for Admissibility!
4) Create Admissibility Graph, Networkx.
5) Calculate pricing/rates for each node, which will be called in optimization.py
7) Calculate avg_dist btwn srcs for occupancy index
Note: Occupancy index is the avg distance of the node from rest of the nodes.
8) Occupancy index is added as weights to the vertices of the graph.
9) Metadata for Vehicles and a list to incorporate them.
10) Call Standard coloring or Weighted vertex coloring! This gives us the color classes.
Note: As we have gone through the cumbersome task of calculating the weights, we shall be using WVC! Pun intended!
11) Operations on the color classes to get the revenue and other results.
12) SUMO to simulate the results of the WVC.

The procedure is followed for the first 3 layers, The last layer of delivery personnel will be solved by Clustering!

Meta-Data:
1) Requests Object: 
Will have conditions which will be used to check admissibility like complementary goods, priority index; for consumables with low shelf life, or higher alertness etc.

2) Vehicle Objects:

Return Orders:
